# DLPC

The TU Delft (www.tudelft.nl) will soon be installing its own Delft High Performance Computer (DHPC).

In 2020, to prepare for this event, to practice using a computer cluster and to inform colleagues of the possibilities, a member of the ICT-Innovation team (https://www.tudelft.nl/ict-innovation/about-innovation/) built a Delft Low Performance Computer (DLPC) from 8 Raspberry PIs, following:
‘Raspberry Pi Supercomputing and Scientific Programming: MPI4PY, NumPy, SciPy for Enthusiasts’ by Ashwin Pajankar, ISBN 9781484228784.

This repository contains the scripts used to prepare a blog about the adventure.
